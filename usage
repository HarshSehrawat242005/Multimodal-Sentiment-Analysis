# Usage Instructions for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Project

## Steps to Run the Pipeline:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher).  
   Run the following command to install all required libraries:

2. **Preprocess the Data**
Preprocessing involves cleaning text data, resizing images, and extracting audio features.  
Run the script:
Processed data will be saved in `processed_data.npy`.

3. **Visualize the Data**
To visualize data distributions and patterns:
This will generate plots to help understand the dataset.

4. **Train the Model**
Train the multimodal sentiment analysis model:
The trained model will be saved as `trained_model.pth`.

5. **Test the Model**
Evaluate the trained model on test data:

6. **Run the Pipeline (Optional)**
To automate preprocessing, training, and testing:

7. **Deployment**
The model can be deployed via a Flask app:
Access the prediction API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict`.

8. **Make Predictions**
You can test the deployment with the following steps:
- Use a REST client (e.g., Postman) or Python's `requests` library.
- Send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with input data.

Example Python script for testing:
```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict"
data = {
    "text": "I love this product!",
    "image": "path_to_image.jpg",
    "audio": "path_to_audio.wav"
}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
